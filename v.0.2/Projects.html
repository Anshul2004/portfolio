                        <p class="card-text">This was the first collabrative project I created in this class. The main focus I had during this project was to learn how to work well with other people and to teach them as well. For this project, my partner and I decided to make a platformer game to learn about how structuring code could help us efficiently create an application. Some features that we included in the project were realistic physics, collision detection, and lava/time contraints to make the game harder as time progresses. We used this project as a way to develop our collaborative skills. This project was quite easy since Scratch provided a very nice interface to work with.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This was the second project I worked on in this class and just like the last one, the main focus I used was to work well with other people. We used MIT App Inventor for this project. My partner and I decided to make a flappy bird like clne for this project. We used the Oh My Spikes tutorial to help us create this application. There were multiple preferences we decided to add after finishing the tutorial. Some of these preferences included realistic gravity simulation and an energy bar to make it progressively difficult as time goes on. We came across numerous challenges while working on this project. One such roadblock was that my partner didn't really understand how to implement the necessary features that we wanted in our game. But, I saw this as an opportunity to improve my teaching skills and set a goal for myself to teach and help my partner understand the implementation.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This project forced my partner and I to use our skills to create a professional project given a time constraint. We decided to get creative with this project and make something that had to do with art. We agreed o making an application which could manipulate images and change them into Van Gough styled paintings. Along the way, we encountered multiple roadblocks but we were able to overcome them and come up with new ideas along the way. My partner and I used the Pillow python library to create the image manipulations. We decided to change the rgba pixel values of the original image to that of a color pallete which we created. This pallete contained colors for which we believed looked like Van Gough styled colors. Numerous other features were implemented as well which resulted in an extremely proficient image manipulating agent.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">I created this mobile application for the 2018-2019 VRC Turning Point. This application contains multiple features which teams can use to scout different alliance partners. Some features this application provides include a match predictor, operated by a FFNN trained from over 3000 past matches, a statistics displayer, a team information displayer, and a notes page as well. My team and I believed that by creating this application, we would be able to utilize its features to effectively scout alliance partners. This app is currently available on the App and Play store. We realized that opening the app up to the public would actually help us. We would be able to use the analytics we recieved from the constant use of the application from users to find out what people look for when they scout for alliane partners. By analyzing what features teams prioritize, we would be able to make our team look presentable.</p>
