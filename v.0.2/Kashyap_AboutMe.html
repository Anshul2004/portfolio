                    <br>
                    <p class="about">Ever since I was a kid, I was always hooked on to technology. The way different machines worked really fascinated me. When I got my first computer, I decided to write a program. It was a simple one, where the computer would output a single line of text. At the time I didn't know it. The fact that that one program, that was 5 lines long, would change my life forever.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="about">I have numerous goals that I hope to fulfill in my software development career. Some of these goals include getting an internship at a top level software/marketing company such as Amazon or Google, creating multiple apps that I can showcase on my college applications, and creating a game development startup that will incorporate virtual reality technology to create an immersive experience. I hope to become a Deep Learning specialist and to create an agent that can think using human level-rationale and  possibly a conscience.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="about">I specialize in Deep Learning, Android and IOS app development, Desktop Application development, (for graphical purposes: Swing library), Server Based Application, and Game development. I hope to become an experienced web developer as well as a data analyst.</p>
