                        <p class="card-text">This was the first collabrative project I created in this class. The main focus I had during this project was to learn how to work well with other people and to teach them as well. For this project, my partner and I decided to make a platformer game to learn about how structuring code could help us efficiently create an application. Some features that we included in the project were realistic physics, collision detection, and lava/time contraints to make the game harder as time progresses. We used this project as a way to develop our collaborative skills. This project was quite easy since Scratch provided a very nice interface to work it as well as </p>

                        <p class="card-text">This was the second project I worked on in this class and just like the last one, the main focus I used was to work well with other people. We used MIT App Inventor for this project. My partner and I decided to make a flappy bird like clne for this project. We used the Oh My Spikes tutorial to help us create this application. There were multiple preferences we decided to add after finishing the tutorial. Some of these preferences included realistic gravity simulation and an energy bar to make it progressively difficult as time goes on. We came across numerous challenges while working on this project. One such roadblock was that my partner didn't really understand how to implement the necessary features that we wanted in our game. But, I saw this as an opportunity to improve my teaching skills and set a goal for myself to teach and help my partner understand the implementation.</p>
